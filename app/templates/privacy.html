<h3>Privacy of our email lists:</h3>

<p>As noted above, we maintain e-mail lists to keep interested, eligible individuals informed about important topics, and individuals must affirmatively request to join them.

<h3>Children's privacy:</h3>

<p>Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).

We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13.</p>

<p>It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13.

<p>Your own efforts to protect against unauthorized access play an important role in protecting the security of your personal information. You should be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer, and always log out of any site when viewing personal information.</p>
