'I Believe In Open' is a national movement to increase government transparency
and accountability in Canada. We're organizing citizens to push politicians
to make five commitments:

1. Support reforms that increase government transparency and accountability.

2. Make campaign promises specific and measurable, and report progress on
promises and their metrics at least semi-annually.

3. Publish the content of his or her daily schedule, including meetings with
lobbyists and special interest groups.

4. Support reforms allowing free access to scientific and survey data gathered
by government institutions.

5. Support reforms that make it easier for Canadians to obtain government
information they have a right to know.

If you support these goals, or would like to know more about them, please

'I Believe In Open' is a project of VisibleGovernment.ca, a newly established
non-partisan, non-profit organization promoting online tools for government
transparency in Canada.
