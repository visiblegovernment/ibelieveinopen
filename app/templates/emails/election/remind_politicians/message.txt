Dear {{politician.fname}} {{politician.lname}},

It's not too late to take a stand for transparency at
'I Believe In Open'. Our campaign website, ibelieveinopen.ca,
is still collecting pledges from MP candidates supporting
the call for greater transparency and accountability in the
federal government.

{% if other_candidates %}
These candidates from your party have already responded:
{% for candidate in other_candidates %}
	{{candidate.fname}} {{candidate.lname}}{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Please take a few minutes to fill out our pledge to show
your constituents where you stand.

You can make your pledge by following this link:

Good luck in the upcoming election.
